# PaymentSystem

The system is an sample of one practice in Martin's Agile Sorftware Development.

I developed this with some new idea in progromming.
  Using maven to build and control dependency.
  Using spring to do the IOC (Not very useful in this project)
  Using the groovy as the main language which can help me to save some codes.
  Using the spock as the testing framework.
  
I use TDD during the coding but most of times I write the test after writing the code.
